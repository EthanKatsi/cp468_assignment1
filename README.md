# CP468 Assignment #1

## Task I:

### Instructions:

Implement the A* algorithm for the 8-puzzle, with heuristics h 1 and h 2 , as discussed in the course textbook. Generate randomly 100 reachable states of the 8-puzzle, solve them with h 1 and h 2 and record in a table the number of steps to find the solution and the number of nodes expanded by A* in each case. Find a third heuristic (h 3 ) for the 8-puzzle from the literature and repeat the 3 above to complete the table. Based on the table, comment on the performance of the three heuristics h1, h2, h3 

## Task II:
