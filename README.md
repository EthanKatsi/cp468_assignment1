# CP468 Assignment #1

## Task I:

### Instructions:

This code implements the A* algorithm for the 8-puzzle, with heuristics:
Heuristics:
**h1:** Misplaced Tiles

**h2:** Manhattan Distance

**h3:** Linear Conflict

The code generates 100 randomly reachable states of the 8-puzzle, solves them with h1 and h2 and records in a table the number of steps to find the solution and the number of nodes expanded by A* in each case.

Sample output:
'''
Puzzle Type          Heuristic  Average Steps to Solution  Average Nodes Expanded
   8-puzzle    misplaced_tiles                      22.13                16395.81
   8-puzzle manhattan_distance                      22.13                 1188.36
   8-puzzle    linear_conflict                      22.13                  644.90
